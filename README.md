# To Do Page (Best to run locally)
A local page I used to use since university to  manage my tasks, the image was for my class timetable which I put into excel and then convert into image to upload there. Just archiving the code here as project collection.
### Nowdays I don't use it as webpage anymore. Instead, I convert it into a desktop app using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).
