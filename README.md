# To Do Page (Best to run locally)
A local page I used to use since university to  manage my tasks, the image was for my class timetable which I put into excel and then convert into image to upload there. Just archiving the code here as project collection.
### Nowdays I don't use it as webpage anymore. Instead, I convert it into a desktop app using [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org).

In case you want to use and run it locally, follow the steps below:
- Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
- Double click on `index.html` to open it in your default web browser.
- Change the image/links in the HTML and CSS file as per your requirement. 
- You can now add tasks to your to-do list by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
